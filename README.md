## Professional Deployment Strategy

This project showcases my understanding of modern deployment practices:

### Automated CI/CD Pipeline
The project uses GitHub Actions for professional, automated deployment:

1. **Push to main branch** - automatically triggers build and deployment
2. **GitHub Actions** - validates commits, builds project, and deploys to GitHub Pages
3. **Live Portfolio**: https://sanajamkatel.github.io

### Deployment Options
```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy to GitHub Pages
npm run deploy
```

## Deployment Configuration

### GitHub Pages Setup
1. Go to repository **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Set **Source** to "Deploy from a branch"
3. Select **main** branch and **/(root)** folder
4. Click **Save**

### Custom Domain (Optional)
- Configure custom domain in repository settings
- Update DNS records for professional branding

## Customization & Extension

### Design System
The color palette and design tokens I created:
```js
theme: {
  extend: {
    colors: {
      primary: '#FF69B4',      // Primary brand color
      'baby-pink': '#FFC0CB',  // Light accent color
      'hot-pink': '#FF1493',   // Deep accent color
    }
  }
}
```

### Content Management
